# TTT-Player-Info-Role-Counter
Fixed missing Type and Base keys!
NOTE: This Addon only works for the "Trouble in Terrorist Town" - Gamemode.
Currently, there are English, Simplified Chinese, and Traditional Chinese languages available. 
The plugin adds a feature to reveal players' roles at the end of the round. 
You can contribute to adding more languages on this website: https://github.com/sbzlzh/ttt_player_info_role_counter
