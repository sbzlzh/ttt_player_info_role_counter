# TTT-Player-Info-Role-Counter

Fixed missing Type and Base keys!
NOTE: This Addon only works for the "Trouble in Terrorist Town" - Gamemode.
Currently, there are English, Simplified Chinese, and Traditional Chinese languages available.
The plugin adds a feature to reveal players' roles at the end of the round.
